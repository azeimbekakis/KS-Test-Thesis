Meeting Notes
——————————————————————————————————————————————
10/26
Introduction
Three questions:
- Why is it interesting/important?
- What has been done?
- What’s new?

KS-Test
- Assumptions:
	- Data needs to be continuous
	- Data needs to be independent
	- Null is completely specified distribution
- Specific member of distribution family
- Violating either invalidates the test
- Test needs to hold its size
- Compare two tests:
	- If both hold under null, higher power is better
	- Show that power level does not hold for discrete
- Demonstrate how poor the test performs with simulated dependent data
- Done, will send notes
——————————————————————————————————————————————
11/8
For next meeting:
- Design simulation study to point out the problem
	- Generate data from 
	- Run KS-Test n times, a = 0.05, calculate power
	- As dependence increases, size deviates from null hypothesis
	- Show that discrete or rounded data invalidates the size of the test
- Suppose normal(0,1) but they are dependent
	- Experiment with sample size as well, dependence level too 0.2, 0.5
	- Record p-value and if correct, should follow uniform(0,1)
	- If dependent though, will not be uniform(0,1)
	- If extra time: rounded data? Choose rounding level
	- Clean up the Git page and manuscript

Section 2: Problem under Serial Dependence
Section 3: Simulation
Section 4: Real Data analysis
Section 5: Conclusion

11/15
Generate random vector of dimension n, sample size
Multivariate normal distribution
Mean vector is 0
Covariance matrix
AR1

For next meeting:
Start putting things into the paper
Set up the bib file
Focus on serially dependent
Understand and implement Weiss paper
——————————————————————————————————————————————
11/29
First do the naive approach, show that dependency invalidates the test
Then implement Weiss’s fix, see how well it works
Any other interesting work? Cited that paper?

Always run two tests
First is naive, then second is better solution
Keep results in xtable r package
**.ds store
——————————————————————————————————————————————
12/2
Histogram of the p-values rather than summarizing
If null is true, histogram should be standard uniform

For next meeting:
For each ar coefficient show histogram
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/103405/prove-expression-for-variance-ar1
Back solve so that sigma x^2 is 1
——————————————————————————————————————————————
12/6
Add parametric bootstrap to paper
Dgof is a package for using ks test with discrete data

For completely specified distribution: parametric bootstrap
For continuous: dgof maybe?
For dependence: maybe block bootstrap version of parametric bootstrap for time series to fix issue with assumption

Can you provide a solution to solve the worst case (all 3 are violated)?

For next meeting:
Apply dgof for rounded data
What if unknown parameters? Parametric bootstrap

Weiss solution?
Can our solutions solve the worst case scenario?
——————————————————————————————————————————————
1/24
For next meeting:
Understand block bootstrap and how it applies to AR1 or AR2. Sim to check if it works
Looks at citations of Weiss paper, see if there is any recent implementation, anything recent with code
Notes into the repo
Ggplot bin-width
50 and 100 for every sample size
——————————————————————————————————————————————
1/31
Fit ar1 model 3 parameters
Arima.sim

Might be able to add noise to break ties in data

Say variance is 1
Generate small normal noise with variance 1/10,000
Sd will be 1/100, assume it does not change the structure

# add small noise compared to variance of x. sd of noise is 1%, or 1/10%, of sd of regular variance
——————————————————————————————————————————————
2/12
assume we know ar1 model, use arima.fit and parametric bootstrap
generate bootstrap from fitted model
maybe introduce ties in observed

Tasks:
1. Fix Ggplot figures
2. Apply sources to introduction
3. Babu and Rao bootstrap
4. Assume ar1 model and perform parametric bootstrap
5. KS general
——————————————————————————————————————————————
2/18
Babu bootstrap bias solution
Draw sample with replacement from observed data, based on bootstrap data you can fit theta hat star, empirical cdf is F*n
From Babu, implement the bias term ks test thing. Perform non-parametric?
——————————————————————————————————————————————
2/25
Babu implementation works for only estimated parameters, not for time series
Inverse cdf sampling method
qnorm(runif(1000))
One step dependence, monotone transformation. Spearman's row transfer
——————————————————————————————————————————————
3/4
Generate from ar, transform to gamma
Probability integral transformation
qgamma instead of qnorm, change fitted parameters
Clayton and other copulas, procedure should work under various copulas, not just normal
Instead of arima, generate from 290-294, but use different copula
Maybe ar2?
If our guess isn't far from the true distribution it may still be reasonably accurate
Generate from ar2

For next time:
1. Generate from ar2 instead of ar1, see if it works well
2. Instead of generating from arima.sim, use the 290-294 loop to generate data. Use different copulas.

——————————————————————————————————————————————
3/11
For next time:
- Work on manuscript
	- show that naive approach does not work, maybe cite some that discover this
- arma(1,1) model test
- test if gamma works
- test different copulas
- potentially real climate data from Steinskog
——————————————————————————————————————————————
3/25
- "Naive" should still perform fix for fitted parameters, but doesn't make fix for correlation
- Could use two naive methods, one for super naive, another for fitted but parametric
- Real data from lanzante possibly
- potentially extreme value distributed data
- When on serial dependence, split it up
	- First with known parameters
	- Then without known parameters where bootstrap must be included
——————————————————————————————————————————————
4/1
Copula is mechanism to form joined distributions, use copula to capture temporal dependence. Nonparametric association.
- incorporates some temporal dependence
- Check if marginal distribution is standard normal
Section 3 also copula, introduce some temporal dependence
Section 4 is the combination of fitted parameters and dependence
——————————————————————————————————————————————

4/10
Write out X1 to Xn

Cannot completely fix this, just trying to get a working dependence. Regardless of true dependence, lets use AR(1). If AR(1) is close approximation to the truth, it can work. Not a complete fix.

Null is that Xi follows cdf F
KS test is designed when F is completely known. But in practice, more likely used for family with unknown parameters. Null in section 2 is that Xi follows F(theta)

Section 3, Xi marginally follows cdf F, but not independent so null is wrong. Have to correct. No unknown parameters with standard normal. Some unknown dependence there

Section 4, Xi follows F(theta), theta unknown and data dependent. 

Section 5, for thesis, conclude. For paper, include real data.

Include all figures. Lanzante page numbers
——————————————————————————————————————————————
Figure caption, describe what they are (this is naive, etc.)
In the text, discuss the results (we would expect but)

Generate x1 from hypothesized distribution, then next one's depend on previous
Assuming normal copula
Given Xt-1, what is the distribution of Xt
Reorder the plots so that Naive is first
X follows some F distribution
Convert so Z, Z follows AR-1 process. Z's follow normal marginally. Transform Z to X
Step 1 generate X*, step 2 generate D*
1. If working dependence is the truth, should be an exact fix. Otherwise, it provides reasonably good fix
