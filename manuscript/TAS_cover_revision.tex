\opening{Dear members of the \textit{The American Statistician} editorial team:}
\vspace{.25in}

\noindent Thank you for the opportunity to revise and resubmit the manuscript 
entitled ``On Misuses of the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov Test 
for One-Sample Goodness-of-Fit'' (TAS-23-210) for possible publication in 
\emph{The American Statistician}.\\

We have now included a new section in the revised manuscript, \textit{Section 5 
Classroom Implementation}, that discusses how elements of this manuscript have 
been incorporated into both graduate- and undergraduate-level teaching at the 
authors' home university. 

We have also included Supplemental Materials that include an \texttt{R} 
implementation of the proposed methods, as well as teaching materials at the 
undergraduate and graduate level. \\

We hope that you continue to find this manuscript to be a valuable contribution 
to the Teacher's Corner in the \emph{The American Statistician}. Please inform 
me if I can provide any additional information or assistance.  
\\

Thank you very much for your continued consideration. I look forward to hearing 
from you.\\

\closing{Best regards,}
